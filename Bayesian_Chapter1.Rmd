This notebook is to practice various methods in Bayesian Inference with R.

This is the overall process for the Bayesian Statistics Notebook.

Learning about heavy proportion of sleepers

### Using Discrete Prior

First let us take some values which indicate our beliefs in the values of P which is the proportion of students who get adequate sleep. We also assign some weights to these proportions which when normalised becomes the prior

```{r}
# Getting the list of proportions which we believe in

p <- seq(0.05,0.95,by = 0.1)

# Setting the weights

prior <- c(1,5.2,8,7.2,4.6,2.1,0.7,0.1,0,0)

# Normalizing

prior <- prior/sum(prior)

# Plotting the same

plot(p,prior,type = "h",ylab = "Prior Probability")
```
